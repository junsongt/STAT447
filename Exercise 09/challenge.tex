\qsol{MH involution} % USE THE SAME TITLES AS ON THE ASSIGNMENT SHEET
This auxiliary variable: $z$ could be considered as a step taken from the current state: $x$. This step has the information of the step size and also the direction. So essentially, the proposed state: $x' = x + z$. Now to make the map from $(x, z)$ to $(x', z')$ to be an involution, or equivalently to ensure the reversibility, then the step taken from the proposed the state $x'$, which is $z'$ should make the destination back exactly to the current state $x$, therefore naturally, $z' = -z$. Hence we could construct an involution> $T_{\sigma}: \R^2 \to \R^2$ as:
\begin{equation}
    T_{\sigma}(x, z) = (x', z') = (x + z, -z) \label{eqn:involution}
\end{equation}
To show $T_{\sigma}$ is an involution on $\R^2$, suppose $(x'', z'') = T_{\sigma}\circ T_{\sigma}(x, z)$, so $x'' = x' + z' = x + z + (-z) = x$ and $z'' = -z' = -(-z) = z$. Hence $T_{\sigma}\circ T_{\sigma}(x, z) = (x, z)$.

In terms of $\abs{J_{T_{\sigma}}}$, note that $T_{\sigma}$ is continuously differentiable, so by (\ref{eqn:involution}), we have: \[\abs{J_{T_{\sigma}}} = \abs{\text{det}\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1\\0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}} = 1\]
