\section{Introduction \& Background}
Among many MCMC algorithms, to avoid unnecessary random walk, there is one type of sampling algorithms that use a deterministic proposal. More explicitly, the map between states can be a deterministic involution if such map is defined on an augmented state space with several auxiliary variables. Such technique was pioneered in \cite{tierney1998}, popularized in HMC \cite{nealHMC}. Additionally, some recent work focusing on auto-selection of step size in HMC like autoMALA \cite{automala}, autostep \cite{autostep}, and several manifold samplers from RATTLE \cite{rattle} and SHAKE \cite{shake} to \cite{manifoldparent} and \cite{Lelievrehmc2019}, have shown other applications of such idea. Particularly, these manifold samplers provided motivations of sampling distributions on some complicated domains, which is related to many intriguing biological and physical problems.


\section{Research Question}
In manifold samplers given in the previous literature(\cite{rattle}, \cite{manifoldparent}), given a point $x \in \mathscr{M}$, the tangent move $v$ is simulated with only one fixed parameter $\sigma$ which is the standard deviation of the distribution of the tangent proposal, i.e. $v \sim N(x, \sigma^2)$. Such move without a tuning parameter $\theta$ is not flexible enough to deal with the changing geometry of the support of the target distribution. One possible issue is that the tangent move is very far so that it fails to get a point $x'$ on $\mathscr{M}$. The other issue could be that the tiny but discrete tangent move might not explore the space efficiently so that the distirbution from samples would not be a good estimate of the target. Hence we wish to borrow the idea of from autoMALA and autostep to incorporate such $\theta$ to dynamically adjust the tangent move and even auto-select $\theta$ to tackle distributions with varying geometries.

% Second, the proposed tangent vector determines a valid landing on the manifold. This means solving constraint equations by Newton solver to check the landing is inevitable every time we make a tangent proposal, But if the solver fails to find a solution, then we will end up having the same samples. But are there any ways that we could make successful proposed tangent vectors more efficiently than blindly re-proposing so that we could have less repeated samples without solving the system of equations too many times?

% Last, we notice that autoMALA can tackle distributions with varying geometries defined on $\R^n$. Moreover, it is a gradient-based method that usually outperforms random walk algorithms. so we are curious: is it possible that autoMALA could be applied to sub-manifold in $\R^n$ with some adjustments so that we could make a more efficient manifold sampler than the original random walk one?

\section{Research Plan \& Methodology}
Combining autostep idea and traditional manifold sampling method will be the prime objective of this project. In order to transplant the idea in autostep from $\R^n$ to $\mathscr{M}$, some modifications must be made, which will be justified in the theorectical part. One potential conjecture inspired by the co-area formula is to make this manifold sampling problem into a contour/level set sampling problem in higher dimension, and transform the target distribution defined w.r.t. Hausdorff/Riemannian measure into some other distribution w.r.t. Lebesgue measure in higher dimensional space. Then apply autostep method to explore the domain along the contour of transformed target.

In the experiment part, we will check the correctness of this modified sampler using MCMC debugging trick called ``random altitude test'' by \cite{ratest}. Then there will be some benchmark tests between the auto-step manifold sampler and usual manifold sampler on some simulated distribution cases.
